# Poinpow
A fabric mod that blocks ads on minehut and adds quality of life utilities. All utilities/features in Poinpow are automatically on. Let me know on [discord](https://discord.gg/NXm9tJvyBT) if anything breaks! (or create an issue on GitHub)

- **BlockMinehutAds** - Blocks ads from minehut that are sent in free servers
  Example: [Minehut] boost your server speed!!! go to this link!!!
- **BlockLobbyAds** - Blocks player made ads in the lobby
  Example: [Ad] NintendoOS: /join fishwind join my server for op yes
- **AutoSkipBarrier** - Automatically skip the ads when joining minehut or free servers

- **BlockFreeCredits** - Blocks the vote messages encouraging free credits
  Example: [Minehut] PuppiesAreNice just got free credits by voting via /vote
